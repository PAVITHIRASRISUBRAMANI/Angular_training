            <h1>How can I find a pet that’s the best fit for my family?</h1>
            <h2>As you begin your search for a new family member, there are a few important things to keep in mind.</h2>
            <h3>Here are some important considerations to help you and your family identity some of the qualities you would like in a new companion animal:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Activity Level – It’s important to consider the energy level of your future pet to ensure it matches that of your family.</li>
                <li>Household Type – The amount of space in your home is an important factor in determining the right adoptable pet for you — a large home or a studio apartment affects the type of pet that makes sense for your current situation.</li>
                <li>Training – Many adoptable pets are already trained, but you should certainly consider the amount of training you want to do to determine both the type and age of your new companion pet.</li>
                <li>There are many more possible considerations — gender, allergies, etc. — so the best way to help ensure your family makes the best decision is to consult an adoption counselor at your local shelter or rescue. They will be able to help you narrow in on selecting a pet that will match your lifestyle, while also ensuring your lifestyle matches the needs of the pet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1><b>What are the benefits of pet adoption?</b></h1>
                   <h2> Adopting a pet comes with numerous advantages including:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You’re saving a life.</li>
                        <li>Millions of healthy, adoptable pets are euthanized every year simply for a lack of a home.</li>
                        <li>When you adopt your pet from a shelter or rescue group, you’re giving a deserving pet a loving home.</li>
                        <li>Many adoptable pets are already trained.</li>
                        <li>When you adopt an older pet, you will often get a sense of their personality and temperament.</li>
                        <li>You also already know their full grown size!</li>
                        <li>An adoption fee can save you money! Adoption fees often include vaccinations, spay/neutering, microchips and other veterinary costs to help prepare the pet for a new home.</li>
